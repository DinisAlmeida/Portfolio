<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
Introduction -- 
For this assessment, I followed some of the components we studied in class this semester, and created some of my own. I haven't done a part of the animations for the forms as I didn't know how to make it through. No coding was done for this assesment.

## First Component - Sightseeing Form
I have created this component as one of those website popups for signing up to the website's eventual topic. I used an image from unsplash and searched for a mountain icon to fill in some of the empty space. I opted for a simplistic design with a very fine and one of my favourite's font "Lato".

## Second Component - Alert Message
I used an app as a base of the design approach to this alert message, again I used Lato as a font and I chose to only have white and black in the alert to follow the aps design.
Wickr is a messaging app with a very good encrypting system to which I am a user myself.

## Third Component - Iphone unlocker type
In this one I inspired myself on the Iphone unlocking slider, with a colourful touch. I have chosen a lighter color on the gradient to give the "unlocking" feeling.

## Fourth Component - Login Page
This login page was made by me a while ago following a youtube video and I chose to use this as I find it to be a simple but effective design.

## Fifth Component - Username type
This was a simple component with different ideas of an username type of form.
